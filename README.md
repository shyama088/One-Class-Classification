# One-Class-Classification

The objective of this project is to classify if a given image is an apple (any object in general).
The train dataset has images of only one class (here apple(s)). 

Work Flow  :
1. Importing packages and reading the dataset
2. Data Pipeline
3. ResNet50 : To featurize the image's
4. PCA : To get the most important features
5. Model Training
6. Predicting output of test data
7. Evaluating the model
